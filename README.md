# OpenMaps-Project-C750
Part 2 of the Udacity Nano Degree Data Analyst

This has the files used in this project. In the directory "OSM Project by Logan Burke" are the 
files used in the creation of the final project. The data files were too large to be uploaded,
so they have been omitted, but links to the datasources are in that directory as a PDF titled
"OpenStreetMap Project by Logan Burke"
